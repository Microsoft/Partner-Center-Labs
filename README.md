# Partner Center Labs
Cloud solution providers achieve scale and profitability by automating management and integrating their existing customer relationship management, billing, and operational systems with the Microsoft Partner Center. Using the Partner Center SDK, partners can create integrations to manage customer accounts, place orders, manage subscriptions, handle support requests, and monitor customers' Azure consumption. This repository contains various labs that will give hands on experience with the Partner Center SDK.

## Prerequisites

* Access to the [integration sandbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/develop/set-up-api-access-in-partner-center)  
* Visual Studio 2017 

    > **Note**: The integration sandbox is required because it is best practice to perform all integration testing in that environment first. If you have not setup your integration sandbox then follow the steps documented at [Setup Your Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/develop/set-up-api-access-in-partner-center#span-idsetupyouraccountsspanspan-idsetupyouraccountsspanspan-idsetupyouraccountsspanset-up-your-accounts).

## Available Labs

### [Azure Utilization](labs/HOL.AzureUtilization/README.md)
Through this lab we will examine how to use the SDK to obtain Azure utilization records and combine them with rate card information.
